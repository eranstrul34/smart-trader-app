# Smart Trader App

This repository contains a simple static market watch list example.

The watchlist displays recommended stocks sorted by daily change from high to low.

Open `watchlist.html` in a web browser to view a table of sample symbols, quotes, and daily changes. Clicking a row opens an analysis page for the selected symbol displaying its RSI and resistance, Bollinger cross, average trade volume, a Yahoo Finance recommendation, and example high and low prices from the past.
